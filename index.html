                <p>
                    Students at UofSC have been struggling to attend online classes, as meeting times are not as straightforward as a physical schedule would be. For example, Zoom does not include any notification system to remind students when meetings will begin, as students are forced to memorize codes and passwords each session, rather than entering them once and being able to press a button to instantly join a Zoom meeting again, making a schedule impossible. Meetings are also spread out over a multitude of different programs including Blackboard, Zoom, and even Discord. Our solution should keep everyone on track for classes by providing notifications for when and where your class will be.

                    As a team, we devised ideas on how students and professors can communicate with each other via online classes. Our main categories include class utilities, notifications, app design, and communication.
